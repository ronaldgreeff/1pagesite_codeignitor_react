# Singe Page Website built with CodeIgniter (and React)

(late 2020) After setting up php, Apache and doing the CodeIgniter tutorials, I decided to build a personal web page using the framework.
In the process I learnt Illustrator to produce a few .svg images I plan to use. I am learning React to better manage front-end development.

The website doesn't use a database, but the data structures used are in the format I'd receive from the database.
